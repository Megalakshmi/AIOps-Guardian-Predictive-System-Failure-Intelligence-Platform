# AIOps Guardian: Predictive System Failure Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview
AIOps Guardian is an AI-based IT operations monitoring system that helps
organizations predict system failures before they occur. The system
analyzes infrastructure behavior, detects abnormal patterns, predicts
potential failures in advance, and identifies root causes to reduce
downtime and improve system reliability.

---

## Problem Statement
Modern IT infrastructures generate large volumes of operational data.
Most failures are detected only after they impact users, resulting in
service downtime, financial loss, and reduced customer trust.
Traditional monitoring systems are reactive and lack predictive
intelligence.

---

## Proposed Solution
This project introduces an intelligent AIOps-based solution that:
- Continuously monitors system performance metrics
- Detects abnormal behavior in system operations
- Predicts possible system failures in advance
- Identifies the root cause of failures
- Provides early alerts for proactive action

---

## Key Features
- System health monitoring dashboard
- Anomaly detection in system behavior
- Failure risk prediction (Low / Medium / High)
- Root cause identification
- Historical analysis of system issues

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Flask (for dashboard)
- GitHub (version control)

---

## Use Case
This system can be used by IT operations teams to proactively monitor
servers, applications, and infrastructure components, helping them
prevent failures before they occur.

---

## Project Status
Initial setup completed.
Further modules and implementation will be added incrementally.
